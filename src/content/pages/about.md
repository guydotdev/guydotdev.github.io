I started my career as—_gasp_—a COBOL programmer. But don't hold
that against me, it just gives me perspective. I've spent much of my
time programming in the most popular of the semi-colon delimited
languages including C++, Java, and JavaScript.

I work for [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a Developer Advocate.
Speaking and teaching are something I thoroughly enjoy—the best way I've found
to monetize my narcissism—and will go to any conference that will have me
and that my boss will pay for. I usually speak about technology with a Redis
angle but have been known to wander into other topics.

In addition to programming computers, I studied electronics in high
school and enjoy building circuits, burning myself with a soldering
iron, and programming small hardware devices such as the Arduino and the
Raspberry Pi. No one has actually _paid_ me to do this sort of work.
Yet.

It was inevitable that I would develop an interest in amateur radio. My
base station is a Yaesu FT-991A with a Tram 1480 for VHF and UHF work
and a homemade 9:1 unun with a 35.5' random wire. I have a cheap Baofeng
for portable use. I enjoy digital modes. My callsign is
[W8GUY](https://www.qrz.com/db/W8GUY) and you can reach me on
[Winlink](https://winlink.org/) if that's your jam.

Outside of tech, I'm a hard-boiled geek interested in role-playing games, science
fiction, and fantasy. I also have a slightly less geeky interest in history
and linguistics and an even less geeky interest in camping and bushcraft. I
watch way too many YouTube videos on all of these topics.

I live in Ohio with my wife and high school sweetheart—they're the same
person, just to be clear. We have three adult sons—Eagle Scouts, all of
them—who visit regularly and are big nerds each in their own way. I
couldn't be prouder.
