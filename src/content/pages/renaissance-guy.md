I’ve been playing tabletop role-playing games since the early 80s. It's the one hobby that has always had a spot in my heart and always will. I look forward to rolling dice with the other nerds at the retirement home. I will never stop.

# Games I Like

Shockingly, I cut my teeth on Dungeons & Dragons. My favorite edition is probably 3rd Edition. But I’ve been doing this a long time and have branched out into other corners of the hobby including:

- Indie games like [Dungeon World](https://dungeon.world/) which mix narrative storytelling with old-school sensibilities.
- Genre-flexible systems like [Savage Worlds](https://peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/) that let me run unique settings.
- Retro-classic masterpieces like [Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition) that just make me happy.
- Old-school classics like GURPS, Rolemaster, and Paranoia.

I have a particular fondness for science-fiction and science-fantasy games, which I think are a bit under-represented in mainstream gaming.

# The Eightfold Forge

Right now I’m developing my own system, which has been a desire since I was in high school. I don't have much to share yet but it'll be setting-generic and flexible enough to support a range of genres.

I’m also building a setting to go with it called The Eightfold Forge. It’s a science fantasy world shaped by ancient alchemy, apocalypse, and astral-powered interstellar travel. Explore the ruins of high magic in the darkness of the void. Or perhaps something less pretentious sounding.

# Gaming + Coding

Sometimes I mash together RPGs and code. [Campaignify](http://guy.dev/campaignify/) is one of those mashings. It's a random campaign idea generator that is whimsical, occasionally nonsensical, but pretty useful when you’re looking for a bit of inspiration. My favorite ideas it's generated for me include:

- You are Robots living in a Zombie Apocalypse setting experiencing events similar to Mad Max.
- You are Children living in an Underdark setting experiencing events similar to Aliens.

The [code is out on GitHub](https://github.com/guyroyse/campaignify) if you want to update the data for the generator.
