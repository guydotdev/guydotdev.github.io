I’m a licensed amateur radio operator, callsign [W8GUY](https://www.qrz.com/db/W8GUY) (formerly KE8VIY), with a General Class license. Like many things in my life, I stumbled into ham radio because of a love of technology.

# My Station

My base rig is a [Yaesu FT-991A](https://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&ProdCatID=102&encProdID=490C4A71118AD0F4E825E89D821B73BB), which is a solid all-in-one radio for both HF and VHF/UHF. My main antenna setup includes a Tram 1480 for VHF and UHF work, and for HF, I use a homemade 9:1 unun feeding a 35.5-foot random wire. Like all random wires, it's a compromise. But it works well enough.

For portable use, I carry a [Baofeng GT-5R](https://www.baofengradio.com/products/gt-5r), which I upgraded with a better antenna and a bigger battery. As those Baofengs are extremely cheap, these upgrades cost more than the radio itself. Someday, I'll get a proper HT.

# Modes of Operation

I like sending bits through the ether and am especially fond of digital and data modes. You’ll find me playing with:

- [APRS](https://how.aprs.works/): Automatic Packet Reporting System
- [FT8](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/index.html): Weak-signal digital communication
- [JS8Call](https://js8call.com/): FT8 with keyboard chat and messaging
- [Packet radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_radio): Classic data mode with a retro charm
- [Winlink](https://www.winlink.org/): Email over radio

I also enjoy participating in my local VHF and UHF nets. I'd like to do more phone work on HF and some [POTA](https://parksontheair.com/), but haven’t invested the time yet.

# Software-Defined Radio

I really like combining code and radio. I've done a couple of presentations on it, complete with demos. If you're into programming as well as radio, check 'em out:

- [Tracking Aircraft with Redis + Software-Defined Radio](https://github.com/guyroyse/tracking-aircraft): I've given this talk at more places than I can count in the U.S. and in Europe. One of the better renditions was at [StirTrek](https://stirtrek.com/), which you can [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UrziHpR5vY).

- [Plucking Data from Thin Air with Software-Defined Radio](https://github.com/guyroyse/plucking-data-from-thin-air): This is a workshop where I show how to collect data using an RTL-SDR, shove it into a database, and then build dashboards showing the data. No video for this one, but the workshop can be done without the talk.

# My QTH

My Maidenhead grid location is EM80mc, which puts me in Central Ohio. I'm a proud member of the [Central Ohio Radio Club (CORC)](http://corc.us/) and the [Delaware Amateur Radio Association (DELARA)](https://www.k8es.org/). If you're in the area, you should check them out.

And if you run into me on the air, at a conference, or at a club, feel free to say hi! I'm a friendly ham.
