    Welcome. My name is Guy and, yes, that's my real name. I'm a husband and father of three, a seasoned software
    developer, a <Link url="https://sessionize.com/guyroyse">public speaker</Link>, and a hard-boiled geek interested in
    more things than I have time for. I share many of those things right here on this website.

    This is my blog. Mostly I write about software development and tech topics, but sometimes I'll write about other
    nerdy topics like <Link url="/w8guy">ham radio</Link> and <Link url="/w8guy">RPGs</Link>—think <em
      >Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em
    > not
    <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. On rare occasions, I may wax poetic about life, the universe, and everything.

    I've been an avid gamer for decades, playing my first game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons sometime in the early 80s. I
    enjoy all sorts of RPGs—not just D&amp;D. Usually, I'm the gamemaster and I like making scenery to run my games. I
    share my play materials here and post <Link url="https://www.youtube.com/@renaissanceguy">videos</Link> occasionally.

    I'm an amateur radio operator who managed to snag the vanity call sign of <Link url="https://www.qrz.com/db/W8GUY"
      >W8GUY</Link
    >. Ham radio is a fairly new hobby to me and I'm constantly learning and tweaking. There's plenty to learn and
    tweak. I share what I've learned here and post the occasional <Link url="https://www.youtube.com/@w8guy-radio"
      >video</Link
    >.
