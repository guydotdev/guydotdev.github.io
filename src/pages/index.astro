    Welcome. My name is Guy and, yes, that's my real name. I'm a husband and
    father of three, a seasoned software developer, a public speaker, and a
    hard-boiled geek interested in more things than I have time for. I share
    many of those things right here on this website.

    This is my blog. Mostly I write about software development and tech topics,
    but sometimes I'll write about other nerdy topics like ham radio and
    RPGs—think <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> not <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.
    On rare occasions, I may wax poetic about life, the universe, and
    everything.

    I'm a software developer with over 30 years of experience. I've worked in
    numerous industries using a variety of languages and technologies.
    Currently, I work for <Link url="https://redis.io">Redis</Link> as a developer
    advocate. I share my work here, on <Link url="https://github.com/guyroyse/"
      >GitHub</Link
    >, and on <Link url="https://www.youtube.com/@guyroyse">YouTube</Link>—where
    I post regular videos.

    I've been an avid gamer for decades, playing my first game of Dungeons &amp;
    Dragons sometime in the early 80s. I enjoy all sorts of RPGs—not just
    D&amp;D. Usually, I'm the gamemaster and I like making scenery to run my
    games. I share my play materials here and post <Link
      url="https://www.youtube.com/@renaissanceguy">videos</Link
    > occasionally.

    I'm an amateur radio operator who managed to snag the vanity call sign of <Link
      url="https://www.qrz.com/db/W8GUY">W8GUY</Link
    >. Ham radio is a fairly new hobby to me and I'm constantly learning and
    tweaking. There's plenty to learn and tweak. I share what I've learned here
    and post the occasional <Link url="https://www.youtube.com/@w8guy-radio"
      >video</Link
    >.
